## TMD-Chiral-Cavity

This repository contains data analysis files for the publication arXiv:2308.04574.

The repository is divided into 3 folders:
-> Transfer_Matrix_Method has a Mathematica notebook Transfer_matrix_method.nb which has the code used for transfer matrix method (TMM) simulations. All necessary files to run the code are present in the Transfer_Matrix_Method/Files folder. One only needs to set the proper path to the files in the notebook after downloading it.
-> 1D_waveguide_model has a Mathematica notebook 1D_waveguide_model.nb. In this notebook we simulate the reflection spectrum and electric field profile of the cavity by simulating it as two two-level emitters coupled to a 1D waveguide.
-> Magnetic_field_sweep has a python notebook MagneticField.ipynb for analysis of the magnetic field sweep data NKT_2p4uW_spot2_512_nW.txt.
